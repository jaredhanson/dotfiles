[Swift](https://www.swift.org/) is a general-purpose programming language that's
approachable for newcomers and powerful for experts.

## Install

### macOS

Swift is included with [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

To use a different version of Swift than that included with Xcode, [download](https://www.swift.org/install/macos/)
the toolchain package for the desired version and run the package installer.
The toolchain will be installed to `/Library/Developer/Toolchains`.

## Usage

To print the version number, execute:

```sh
swift --version
```


```
xcrun --toolchain swift swift --version
```
